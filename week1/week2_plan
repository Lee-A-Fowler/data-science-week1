WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Lee Fowler
Date: 20-02-2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: Inconsistent/impossible negative values, and check if body mass unit/decimal place is correct.

Which tutorial provides the solution: 7 Check Data Consistency

Which variable(s) affected: body_mass_mg

Why this is important to fix: 
The impossible negative values will skew the data and make means, analysis results, etc. incorrect. If the unit or decimal place is wrong for some/most values, any analysis will be wrong.

What I plan to do: 
Remove "-" from all impossible negative values that would be within normal range when positive, and check if small body mass values (<10 are within a believable range)


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: Duplicate rows

Which tutorial provides the solution: 4 Duplicates

Which variable(s) affected: all variables

Why this is important to fix: unhelpful weighting given to duplicate values, analysis may be incorrect, show false results.

What I plan to do: Create new column with duplicates removed.


OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - will address later if time]
- Missing data
- [Issue 5 - decided to leave as-is because...]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Is there an easy way to see what different date formats have been used in a dataset?

2. 

3.
